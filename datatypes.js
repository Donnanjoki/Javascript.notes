/* Javascript has 7 primitive data types and 1 non-primitive data type
the primitive data types include:

1. number: which includes numbers of any kind either an integer or floating-point.
2. bigInt: for integer numbers of arbitrary length
3. string: for strings
4. booleans: for true/false
5. null: for unknown values
6. undefined: for unassigned values
7.symbol: for unique identifiers

the non-primitive data types 
8. object: for more complex data structures.

//Numbers

/*
>> Numbers represent both integer and floating numbers
>> Additionally there are "special numeric values" which too belong to this data type
they include:  Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

*/

//BigInt

/* This data type is used since the number type cannot represent integer values lager than ((2^53)-1) or less or less than -((2^53)-1) for negatives.
 >> a BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of the integer
*/

//String

/*
>> A string must be surrounded by quotes
