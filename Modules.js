Chapter 10: Modules >>> Based off the Definitive Guide




**** Summary ****
>. The goal of modularity is to allow programmers to hide implementation details of their code so that chunks of code form various sources
can be assembled into large programs without worrying that one chunk will overwrite functions or variables of another.

>. In early days, modularity could be attained through the clever use of immediately invoked function expressions.

>. Node added its own module system on top of the Javascript language. Node modules are imported with require() and define their exports by setting properties
 of the Exports object or by setting the module.exports property.

>. In ES6, Javascript finally got its own module system with import and export keywords and ES2020 is adding support
for dynamic imports with import().
